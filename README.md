a tool that estimate future SDEs in olympics using data

## brief introduction

This project utilizes the entropy weight method, TOPSIS, and least squares to construct a multi-level model for predicting whether a specific sport will be included in the Olympics. The input consists of several sub-indicators for each sport. Using a sliding window approach, data from the previous two years is used to predict the subsequent year's data. By combining the weights of each sub-indicator, the model ultimately outputs whether the sport will be included.
